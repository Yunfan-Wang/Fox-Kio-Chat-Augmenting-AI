Goal wizard: 
1. I want the final price to be 90 with a little rebate for me, say 0.5 cent per deal.
2. (Business)
3. I don't want to push too hard

Opponent boss: The price is non-negotiable 100 per unit.
Me: The price is a little bit too high
Opponent boss: Name your price
Me: Would 50 dollars be fine?
Opponent boss: It's just too high a price I can take
Me: Let's round it up to 75?
Opponent boss: I would still stick with 100, but I can offer you some rebate after we done with the first bill transaction.
